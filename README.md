# Convolutional-Neural-Network-on-CIFAR-10-dataset-VGG-16-Model-
 For this practical work, we will use the very famous CIFAR-10 dataset. It consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The training and testing set can be found directly from keras.
